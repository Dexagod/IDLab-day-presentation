    <h2>Attention grabber</h2>

    <!-- 
      ## Traveling case 
      I like going on vacation, but personally I am a horrible person to ask to plan trips.
      Because doing stuff on the Web is so much work.
      Booking flight tickets, looking for interesting places where you are staying, booking hotels, ...
      
      ## Data syncing case
      Supermarket with outdated data

      ## Job market ...
      The interest in your data is enorm on the Web. They are required for trainign models, advertising, 
      ... but also just to provide good service.

      # Main Message
      In the current Web ecosystem, your data does not work for you, it works for the services that store it!

  <div class="slide" id="need">
    <h2>
      We need integration of personal data<br>
       without platform dependency
    </h2>

    <!-- 

      Services should be able to integrate personal data, without requiring platformization.
      Personal data should be 
      - accessible 
      - automatically integratable
      - trackable
      - service-independent

      Whe need a vision to make this happen:

      - How can we make personal data a core part of the Web ecosystem
      - What systems do we need
      - What interactions are required
      
      Solid is a part of this vision!
      
      # Main Message
      There is a need for integration of personal data on the Web in a platform-independent way

    <h2>Task</h2>
    
    <!-- 
      We need to make the vision concrete
      For this, we can find inspiration in our 
      societal structure of powers, and map this 
      to the Web ecosystem.      

      # Main message
      Create a safe and able environment for exchanging and integrating personal data over the Web

    <h2>Main message</h2>

    <!-- 
      By separating the concerns for our personal data,
      we can enable a more flexible ecosystem that can
      integrate with our personal data, while giving
      users more control and overview over their data on the Web.

    <h2>Point1</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        making data available on the Web in a flexible way, we want to maximize the possibility to integrate with our data
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 
      Agents, services and other agents on the Web require access to personal data to provide services to the user. 
      Messaging apps require your messages, contact lists. 
      Others require calendar information, exchange of personal documents, etc … 
      To bring the integration of personal data in the Web ecosystem to a new level, 
      where user-centric storage, automated integration and more becomes a possibility, 
      we investigate the ways that Personal Data Vaults on the Web can provide access to user data in a concise manner. 
      Trying to match the client data requirements, to the available data in the KG of the data vault, 
      and matching these requirements on what it is allowed to provide. 
      By enabling interfaces to be flexible in this way, 
      we can transcend the requirements of rigid agreements on storage locations, data modeling, etc … 
      and enable a more flexible integration of personal data in the Web.

        protecting data on the Web, try to automate user behavior and wishes, business processes, ...

    <!-- 
      Now of course, this in itself incites the reaction of safety, privacy, … 
      For this, policies for the basis of answering the question of how we can express 
      user preferences, business rules, … and more in a Web environment. 
      We need to translate user habits, company policies, and more into an understandable, 
      flexible framework that can be interpreted by services in the semantic Web such as personal data vaults. 
      This way, we can support integration of data in a secure way over the Web.

      policy
      - compliance (are the policies according to set rules e.g. country regulations)
      - validation (are the policies sensible? are there conflicts?)
      - enforcements (policies need to be enforced)

    <h2>Point3</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        provide overview of data on the Web, and keep track of exchanges. We have receipts when exchanging money for services, we should do the same when exchanging data for services
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 
      everybody makes mistakes, and often times people will share data without knowing that is stored in data Silos on the Web. 
      For this, we look at Data receipts as a way of making users aware where their data is stored on the Web. 
      When exchanging money for services, a receipt is made, so that you can remember, prove, … that a deal was made.
      For data on the Web, this exchange is ephemeral.  Data is interchanged for services without any notion of receipts in sight. 
      To provide users with an oversight of their data exchanges on the Web (at least from the perspective of their personal data stores), 
      we propose the notion of <doubly signed> data receipts as an oversight of activity on the Web, a safeguard for malicious data retrieval 
      (when things slip by the protection of the policies). This can be used to detect misuse.

    <h2>Point4</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        putting these things into action, we can enable agents to flexibly exchange parts of their internal knowledge graphs according to their interfaces and policies, and control the interactions in hindsight using our receipts to detect misuse. This allows much more flexible integration of data in the Web ecosystem
